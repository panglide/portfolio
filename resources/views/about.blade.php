  <h2>About</h2>
  <p class="about-text">
      I am a self-taught web developer who began learning web application development
      because I wanted to build out an idea.  Little did I know, that simple
      decision to "try it out" would shift my entire paradigm.  Now I am a code junkie
      who cannot get enough.  I don't beleive that will ever change becuase I REALLY enjoy
      building web applications.

      I hope you will register for an account and visit often.  I hope this
      blog will offer some value to those who are starting out and need a roadmap.
      I hope that I can pay it back in some way because, I have definitely used my
      fair share of the free resources spanning the www.
