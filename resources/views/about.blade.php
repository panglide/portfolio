  <h2>About</h2>
  <p class="about-text">
      Thanks for stopping by to visit my little piece of the wwww.
      I am a self-taught web developer who began learning web application development
      because I wanted to build out an idea.  Little did I know, the
      decision to give it a go and try it out would impact my life so greatly.  Now I am working as a freelance web developer
      because I love building web based products.  Please contact me if you have a project you are stuck on.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
      It is my intention to make this site a resource for people like myself who are trying to figure web
      development out.  Right now it is just me making something that works but, I hope as my knowledge and experience grow I can add more
      resources that will help someone find their way in this crazy world of web development.
